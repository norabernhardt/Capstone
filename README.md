# Bibbo

bibbo is a use case for scientific libraries and reads files from the weekly "new release service" of Deutsche Nationalbibliothek and writes them into a database. Through generated API, filtered results are published to bibbo's website, hosted on an EC2 instance. Through bibbo, you will save time while browsing for new publications suiting your interests.
